# Project Euler

These are my attempts at solving the [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) problems.
For now, I use Python (as it is the only language I know by heart), but I might use it to learn other languages as well at some point.

The scripts all are executable, for example
```shell
./1_Multiples_of_3_or_5.py
```
